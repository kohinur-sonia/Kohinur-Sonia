# Data Analytics with Power BI & Tableau
This repository demonstrates my analysis of a retail dataset, exploring sales, profits, discounts, regions, and customer segments using **Power BI** and **Tableau**. The aim is to uncover trends, correlations, and actionable insights for business decisions.

**Key Steps:**
1. Connected and cleaned the dataset (fixed dates, removed duplicates, handled missing values).
2. Added calculated columns and measures in Power BI (e.g., Month Name, Sum of Orders).
3. Built dashboards for storytelling and visual exploration.

## Dataset
* Retail dataset columns: 
  * Order ID, Sales, Profit, Quantity
  * Region & State
  * Category & Subcategory
* Prepared for business analytics: sorting, aggregation, and mapping ready

## Tools & Techniques
* **Power BI:** Data modeling, DAX calculations, dashboards
* **Tableau:** Rapid visual exploration, storytelling dashboards
* **Visualization Types:** Bar charts, line charts, bubble charts, maps, stacked bars, pie charts

## Visualizations & Insights
1. **Profit by Category** – Bar chart
2. **Quantity, Sales & Profit by Category** – Text table
3. **Region-wise Sales** – Bubble chart
4. **State-wise Profit Map** – Filled map using latitude & longitude
5. **Yearly & Monthly Sales Volume** – Line chart
